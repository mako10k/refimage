# Requirements Specification

## Overview
We are building an **API-based image store middleware** that supports semantic image search using vector embeddings. The core idea is to leverage **OpenAI's CLIP model** and **FAISS** to allow users to upload images and perform text-based searches for similar images. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a multi-modal model that maps images and text into the same latent vector space:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, enabling intuitive image searches by text description. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides efficient indexing and approximate nearest-neighbor search on these high-dimensional vectors, ensuring fast retrieval even for large image datasets:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Additionally, the system will include a **domain-specific language (DSL)** for advanced search patterns, which can be dynamically constructed (for example, by an LLM) to handle complex queries. The API will be built with **FastAPI** in Python, and the image embedding computations will use **PyTorch** (for the CLIP model).

## Functional Requirements

1. **Image Upload & Embedding**: The system shall provide an endpoint to upload an image. Upon receiving an image, the system must process it by generating a vector embedding using a pre-trained CLIP model. The image file (or a reference to it) and its embedding should be stored for later retrieval. Each stored image should have an associated identifier and metadata (e.g., filename, upload timestamp, any user-provided tags).
2. **Text-Based Search**: The system shall allow searching for images via a text query. The query text will be converted into an embedding using the CLIP text encoder. The system will then perform a similarity search in the image embedding index (see requirement 5) to find images whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding. The search should rank results by similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity) to the query.
3. **Search Pattern DSL**: The system shall support a custom **search pattern DSL** that enables complex query compositions. This DSL will allow combining multiple queries or applying filters in ways that go beyond a single text query. For example, the DSL might support logical operators like AND/OR/NOT on concepts (embeddings) or weighting of different query terms. A query expressed in this DSL will be parsed by the system and executed by performing the specified combination of vector searches and filtering of results.
4. **Dynamic Query Composition via LLM**: The system should be capable of integrating with a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language descriptions of complex searches and translate them into the DSL from requirement 3. This means a user could provide a complex search request in plain language (e.g., "photos of beaches at sunset with no people"), and an LLM (given the DSL grammar) would produce a corresponding DSL query which the system can then execute. (Implementing the LLM itself is outside the scope of this project, but the middleware should be designed to accept a DSL query generated externally.)
5. **Vector Indexing & Similarity Search**: The system must index all image embeddings in a vector database to enable fast nearest-neighbor search. We will use **FAISS** for this purpose, taking advantage of its ability to handle large numbers of vectors efficiently:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. The index should support adding new image vectors as images are uploaded. When a search query is issued (either a basic text query or a DSL-based composite query), the system should query the FAISS index to retrieve the top _k_ most similar image embeddings.
6. **Result Retrieval and Scoring**: For any search operation, the system shall return a list of results with each result containing:
    - A reference to the image (e.g., image ID or URL/path).
    - Relevant metadata about the image (e.g., original filename, any tags or descriptions).
    - A similarity score or distance value indicating how closely the image matches the query.
   The results should be ordered by highest relevance (highest similarity or lowest distance).
7. **API Design**: All functionality shall be exposed through a RESTful API built with **FastAPI**. The API endpoints should include (but are not limited to):
    - `POST /images` for image upload (the request includes the image file and optional metadata; on success returns the assigned image ID or confirmation).
    - `GET /search` for basic text query search (with the query string as a parameter, returns search results).
    - `POST /search` (or a different endpoint) for advanced DSL query execution (accepting a DSL query in the request body and returning results).
    - (Optional) `GET /images/{id}` to retrieve an imageâ€™s metadata (and possibly the image itself or a thumbnail) by ID.
   The API should follow standard conventions and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 201 Created for successful upload, 200 OK for search results, 400 Bad Request for invalid input).
8. **Tech Stack Requirements**: The implementation must use **Python** for the backend. The CLIP model will be utilized via **PyTorch** (and associated libraries) for embedding generation. **FastAPI** will be used to define the web API, and **FAISS** (with its Python bindings) will be used for vector search. The system should be containerizable (e.g., via Docker) for easy deployment. All key dependencies and versions should be documented (for example, in a `requirements.txt` file).
9. **Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle a growing number of images and frequent search queries. This implies the ability to update or rebuild the FAISS index incrementally as new images are added without significant downtime. The index may be persisted to disk for quick loading on service restart. The design should also consider memory usage (storing many embeddings in RAM) and might employ FAISS indexing strategies (like IVF or PQ indexes) if the dataset becomes very large.
10. **Security**: If the service is used in a multi-user context, it should enforce basic security measures. This may include authentication for API endpoints (to control who can upload or search images) and authorization if needed for per-user image privacy. Data transfer should use HTTPS for encryption in transit. (Detailed security and user management can be addressed in a later iteration, but the design should not preclude these additions.)

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The system should provide fast search responses. A typical text query search should return results within a few hundred milliseconds, assuming a moderately sized image dataset and proper indexing. The use of precomputed embeddings and FAISS ensures that most queries are resolved via efficient vector computations.
- **Reliability**: The service must handle errors and edge cases gracefully. For example, it should detect and reject invalid files (non-image data) on upload, handle extremely large images by resizing or rejecting with an error, and survive restarts without losing data (if using persistent storage for images and indices). The CLIP model should be loaded once and reused for all requests to avoid initialization overhead.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should be organized into clear modules (e.g., a module for the API endpoints, a module for embedding and search logic, etc.). It should be well-documented with comments and provide README or developer instructions for setup. Configuration options (such as model type, index parameters, etc.) should be easy to adjust. Automated tests (unit and integration tests) are recommended for core functionality (embedding generation, search results correctness).
- **Extensibility**: The architecture should allow future enhancements. For instance, replacing CLIP with a newer embedding model, or integrating a different vector database, should be feasible with minimal changes by abstracting the embedding and index interfaces. Similarly, the DSL can be extended with new capabilities (such as geo-filtering if images had location metadata, or applying image attribute filters) without overhauling the system.
